Se acusaba a La Caixa entre otras cosas de:</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Enga\u00f1ar a personas trabajadoras, pensionistas o desempleadas con productos de ahorro \u201cte\u00f3ricamente seguros\u201d <em>(</em>participaciones preferentes, deuda subordinada y otros productos \u201ct\u00f3xicos\u201d<em>)</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Desahuciar a miles de personas de sus casas</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Invertir en empresas de armamento</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Perdonar la deuda a partidos pol\u00edticos a cambio de concesiones</li>\n</ul>\n<div>El veredicto fu\u00e9 que <strong>La Caixa es culpable</strong>.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Una\u00a0 acampada se instal\u00f3 ese mismo d\u00eda frente a la sede de la Caixa en lo que se ha llamado\u00a0 #occupymordor. A pesar del desalojo de la acampada #occupymordor\u00a0 realizado hacia las 00.45 horas de la madrugada del 17 de mayo, todos\u00a0 los d\u00edas se ha venido realizando una <strong>#caixarolada y #pit\u00f3dromo </strong>frente a las oficinas centrales de La Caixa.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>#Occupymordor no ha aparecido en los grandes medios. La semana pasada altos directivos de \u201cLa Caixa\u201d llamaron a peri\u00f3dicos, radios y televisiones<em> </em>con\u00a0 el objetivo de imponer el silencio informativo respecto a la acci\u00f3n\u00a0 #occupymordor.

Tod@s podemos conseguirlo a trav\u00e9s de esta c<strong>ampa\u00f1a de hackeo de peri\u00f3dicos. Es muy f\u00e1cil:</strong></div>\n<div><strong>1.

    "rendered": "<p>On May 5, 2010, I open up the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and I could puke. There was this photo of a man on fire, just a bunch of flames with a leg sticking out. Two others burnt with him on a pretty spring day in Athens.</p>\n<p>The question is, who did it?</p>\n<p>If you read the U.S. papers, the answer was obvious. A bunch of olive-spitting, ouzo-guzzling, lazy Greek workers who refused to put in a full day\u2019s work, and retired while they were still teenagers on pensions fit for pasha, had gone on a social services spending spree using borrowed money. Now that the bill came due and the Greeks had to pay with higher taxes and cuts in their big fat welfare state, they ran riot, screaming in the streets, busting windows and burning banks with people inside.</p>\n<p>Case closed.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t buy it. It wasn\u2019t just a feeling in my gut, it was the document in my hand, marked, \u201cRESTRICTED DISTRIBUTION. ITS CONTENTS MAY NOT BE OTHERWISE DISCLOSED. MAY BE USED BY RECEIPIENTS (sic) ONLY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR OFFICIAL DUTIES.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, it\u2019s my official duty as a journalist to disclose it. The firebombing, the mobs in the streets of Athens, mass unemployment, the empty pension funds and the angry despair that would sweep across Europe in 2010 began with a series of banking transactions crafted in the United States and Switzerland. The plan was 18 years old, and here it was played out in the streets of Greece, then Spain and Portugal, and before that in Latin America and Asia. The riot was written right into it.</p>\n<p>When I ask, <em>Who did it?</em> I don\u2019t mean the damaged fool who threw the Molotov cocktail into a crowded bank. I\u2019m looking for the men in the shadows, the very big make-the-monkey-jump men who turned economies into explosive kindling, lit the fuse, then stood first in line at the fire sale.</p>\n<p>I have their phone numbers.</p>\n<p>The phone numbers came from a memo about a so-called \u201cend-game.\u201d The ominous note (shown above), also marked confidential, was written by Tim Geithner and addressed to Larry Summers. Over time, Summers and Geithner each would take a turn as U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, but in November 1997, they had higher posts, as Masters of the Financial Universe. Unfortunately these notes were just a bunch of paper not worth bothering with unless I could get confirmation they were legit. And that would require an expensive trip to Geneva to meet with World Trade Organization Director-General Pascal Lamy.</p>\n<p>Before working for the WTO, Lamy ran Le Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, the French megabank. The fit and sparkly Frenchman, comfortable with himself and confident, dressed down for our meeting in a powder blue sweater vest.</p>\n<p>I spread my cards and documents on the table, fanned them out like a Texas poker player who\u2019d drawn an inside flush. Across the cover of the thick one on top was a clearly ineffective note:</p>\n<p>\u201cEnsure this text is not made publicly available.\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiled. Lamy is too smart to ask how I got them, too smart to defend them and excellent at explaining why they don\u2019t actually exist. \u201cThe WTO was not created as some dark cabal of multinationals,\u201d the banker insisted. But the meeting notes of this noncabal made for some pretty interesting reading. It took an hour and a half to go over each, especially the one you could call the Magna Carta of Globalization.</p>\n<h6>\u2018Risk, shmisk\u2019</h6>\n<p>You know what the perfect crime is?</p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s the one that\u2019s not illegal.</em></p>\n<p>Sanford \u201cSandy\u201d Weill must have thought John Dillinger was schmuck.</p>\n<p>Weill didn\u2019t bother with a few greenbacks in the bank vault. Weill stole the whole bank. In April 1998, Weill\u2019s company, Travelers Group, an agglomeration of investment banks and other hot financial operations, took over Citicorp. Weill, now running the freshly minted Citigroup, made millions off the deal. The merger was brilliant\u2013and against the law.</p>\n<p>While Dillinger, the fool, used fast getaway cars and Tommy guns to avoid the law, Weill simply had the law repealed.</p>\n<p>The law was the Glass-Steagall Act, signed by President Roosevelt in 1933. Glass-Steagall prohibited banks that take deposits (\u201ccommercial\u201d banks) from merging with \u201cinvestment\u201d banks. Investment banks, despite the upright name, are financial casinos, which can make high-stakes, high-risk bets on stocks, bonds, currencies, derivatives, weather, whatever.</p>\n<p>Glass-Steagall was based on a deal FDR made with banks during the Great Depression: The government would guarantee savings accounts, but the banks could not then use those government-backed deposits to finance loading up a poker table with chips to play a two-pair bluff.</p>\n<p>Of course, the world would be a much happier place today, and Greece would not have burned, if Weill and his fellow banksters had simply taken a trillion dollars and blown it on a weekend in Vegas.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve done a quick calc on Weill\u2019s deal that broke the law (I mean, literally shattered it). The stock of the combined Weill companies popped up by $24 billion on the day of the announcement. Nice. The fools and the fleeced were told the combine \u201ccreated value.\u201d The hell it did. It created a government guarantee for Sandy\u2019s casinos. The American public, in effect, put up insurance valued at $24 billion of Citigroup.</p>\n<p>Weill\u2019s bank heist was an inside job. Removing the law that formed the rock-solid foundation of America\u2019s financial structure would require a lot of demolition work by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin, who recommended that Congress repeal Glass-Steagall and oversaw the Treasury as it helped to relax similar global financial regulations. Bob Rubin\u2019s jackhammer on Glass-Steagall was effective\u2013the law\u2019s demolition was signed on November 12, 1999, just four months after Rubin left Treasury and just two weeks after he joined Sandy Weill to help run Citigroup.</p>\n<p>Rubin picked up $126 million in payments from Sandy\u2019s now-legal operation. That was not a payoff. That was compensation. There\u2019s a difference: six letters. Count \u2018em.</p>\n<p>When Rubin left the Treasury for Citi, he put his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Summers and Geithner in charge; Summers to take Rubin\u2019s post, and Geithner sent to Geneva on a very special assignment.</p>\n<p>Soon Goldman Sachs et al. were cranking out new derivative \u201cproducts\u201d faster than bed sheets from a whorehouse laundry. Some gray-hairs worried about the risk. Risk, shmisk. With explicit and implicit government guarantees, the bankers were ready to go double-or-nothing on insecure securities.</p>\n<p>Summers, like Rubin before him, body-blocked all attempts to regulate the derivatives market.</p>\n<h6>Arson investigation</h6>\n<p>So, who lit the fires in Greece?</p>\n<p>Luckily, some birdies flew over our office and dropped several papers through the transom. One memo, dated November 24, 1997, was written by Assistant Treasury Secretary for International Affairs Tim Geithner to Deputy Secretary Larry Summers.</p>\n<p>Geithner wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As we enter the end-game of WTO financial services negotiations, I believe it would be a good idea for you to touch base with the CEOs of the major U.S. banking and securities firms which have been closely following the WTO financial services negotiations. I suggest you contact, via phone call, the following firms individually.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Geithner advised Summers to call Bank of America\u2019s David Coulter, Citibank\u2019s John Reed, Chase Manhattan\u2019s Walter Shipley, Goldman Sachs\u2019 Jon Corzine and Merrill Lynch\u2019s David Kamansky.</p>\n<p>But what did Geithner mean by \u201cthe end-game\u201d that this list of illustrious money managing CEOs should be consulted on? Let\u2019s piece together how the game began. In 1997, there were two burning questions for Summers, Geithner, Rubin, Weill and the gang.</p>\n<p>The first was, \u201cWhat if shit happens?\u201d What if the decriminalized trade in weird securities goes bad? Where can the United States dump its toxic assets?</p>\n<p>Rubin\u2019s deputy secretary, Summers, would apply the same solution he had suggested earlier, in 1991, regarding chemical toxins. Then chief economist of the World Bank, Summers wrote a memo stating that poor nations are \u201cUNDER-polluted\u201d (his own caps), so the West should dump more toxins there. When the memo leaked, Summers said it was a joke. It was certainly a joke, but it was also, under Summers, World Bank policy. Summers would make the rest of the planet swallow toxic financial assets. Let Ireland, Brazil, Portugal and Greece pay cash money to take on the U.S. bankers\u2019 risk.</p>\n<p>The second question for the bankers was, \u201cHow do we bust down financial rules across the planet?\u201d It was not enough to erase the laws against speculating with bank deposits in the United States if it was still a crime to do so in Brazil, India, Spain and Greece. In most nations, betting government-guaranteed savings accounts on funky securities remained verboten.</p>\n<p>What to do? You can\u2019t engineer enough coup d\u2019\u00e9tats and install General Pinochets everywhere. So then, how to change the laws of 152 nations with a single coup? Treasury called a meeting.</p>\n<p>From the memos, it appears there were little gatherings of Treasury with the five CEOs mentioned above whom Geithner had urged Summers to consult. How could they make 152 nations bust apart their banking laws and allow purchases of U.S. toxic assets?</p>\n<p>The answer was to take a minor trade treaty, the Financial Services Agreement (FSA), and turn it into the new finance law of the planet. In their closed little gatherings, this bankers\u2019 roundtable rewrote the FSA, with protocols forcing every nation to remove restrictions and old-fashioned safe-banking regulations. The rewritten agreement would require every nation to allow trade in new financial products, whether magical or toxic. It would blow apart any nation\u2019s laws restricting foreign bankers.</p>\n<p>The agreement, once signed, would trump any attempt by any Congress or Parliament to restore protections. The agreement also dictated that, once demolished, the barriers could not be rebuilt. Return to regulation, called \u201cclaw-back,\u201d would be severely punished. Any resisting nation would be put on the economic wheel and broken.</p>\n<p>In 1997, Assistant Treasury Secretary Geithner was sent to Geneva, to WTO headquarters, with this new law in his diplomatic bag. He was assigned to inform the ambassadors of all 152 nations, no exceptions allowed, that they would have to sign it. <em>Or else</em>.</p>\n<p>Or else <em>what</em>?</p>\n<p>Sometimes, people\u2013and nations\u2013have to eat shit. But no one orders it from the menu. The waiter has to hold a gun to your head.</p>\n<p>If a country wanted to trade with the United States, it would have to buy the bankers\u2019 financial \u201cproducts.\u201d It was a brilliant idea. If a nation wanted to sell American goods, they would have to swallow American bads\u2013the derivatives, swaps and all the other exotica coming out of the mad bankers\u2019 laboratories. Furthermore, Citibank, JP Morgan and other banks would be allowed to jump into these nations\u2019 markets and suck out capital at will. Local banks would be deregulated.</p>\n<p>Geithner headed off to the WTO in Geneva, and when I was passed a copy, it was still smoking.</p>\n<h6>\u2018Gold-painted funds\u2019</h6>\n<p>Geithner wrote about an end-game, but what game were they playing? World Trade negotiations used to be about trade in goods\u2013you know, my computers for your bananas. But the bankers, through the mucked-with Financial Services Agreement, had switched the game board.</p>\n<p>The juiciest target of the new FSA would be China. China wanted to sell us everything we used to make ourselves. The United States would agree to let their stuff in, but in return, China would have to join the WTO, sign the treaties, and buy what America makes now: banking \u201cproducts.\u201d China would have to let Citibank and JP Morgan set up shop in Shanghai.</p>\n<p>In effect, U.S. manufacturing jobs would be sold for the bankers\u2019 right to gamble in the new market. The score? During the last decade, U.S. multinationals shed 2.9 million employees in America while increasing their foreign workforces by 2.7 million.</p>\n<p>In May 2010, the end-game ended for Greece.</p>\n<p>The new financial products were packaged, polished to a shine and sold to government pension funds all over the planet. The bankers sold blind sacks of sub-prime mortgages, sliced and mixed up, as Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) and other fetid concoctions. The Financial Services Agreement was rockin\u2019!</p>\n<p>But when opened, buyers found the bags were filled with financial feces. Government pensions and sovereign funds\u2013from Finland to Qatar\u2013lost trillions. The bags were toxic to bank balance sheets and several failed. In most cases, however, bankers could get a refill of capital juice from governments fearful of full-bore financial collapse. Re-funding banks meant de-funding economies: pension cuts, salary cuts, all the things that bring an economy to its knees. And sets it on fire.</p>\n<p>When Bankers Gone Wild slammed the planet into recession, Greece\u2019s main industry, tourism, lost two million visitors who were too broke, too panicked, for beach party vacations and ouzo.</p>\n<p>And the more Greece lost, the greater \u201cthe spread.\u201d</p>\n<p>A spread is the extra interest demanded by speculators and banks to insure against a nation\u2019s bankruptcy and default. When sold as a derivative, the bankruptcy insurance is called a credit default swap (CDS).</p>\n<p>How could that happen?</p>\n<p>In 2001, investment bank Goldman Sachs secretly bought up $1.4 billion in Greek government debt, converted it into yen and dollars, and sold it back to Greece at a big loss. Goldman isn\u2019t stupid. The deal was a con, with Goldman making up a phony-baloney exchange rate for the transaction, hiding the Greek debt as an exchange rate loss, and working a scam to get repayment of the \u201closs\u201d from the government over time at loan-shark rates. Through this crazy and costly legerdemain, Greece\u2019s right-wing free-market government was able to pretend its deficits never exceeded 3 percent of GDP.</p>\n<p>Cool. Fraudulent but cool. Fraudulent but legal. Read your Financial Services Agreement.</p>\n<p>Flim-flam isn\u2019t cheap these days: On top of murderous interest, Goldman charged the Greeks more than a quarter billion dollars in fees.</p>\n<p>And those rotting bags of CDOs sold by Goldman and others? Did they know they were handing their customers gold-painted turds? Well, in 2007, at the same time banks like Goldman were selling sub-prime mortgage securities to Europeans, the firm itself was betting that the securities they created were crap. That\u2019s right: Goldman shorted the securities it was selling, and picked up half a billion dollars on the bet. Now, if General Motors built a car they knew would fall apart, would the company be praised, as Goldman has been, for the brilliance of offloading the junkers to unsophisticated rubes?</p>\n<p>So Greece went down. It was the spread itself, the premium for the bankruptcy insurance that put Greece into bankruptcy. It\u2019s as if a fire insurance company set fire to your house and then charged you higher premiums because you had a fire.</p>\n<h6>Riot tourist</h6>\n<p>Not everyone runs from a burning building or a burning nation. Riots have their fans. One riot tourist couldn\u2019t wait to get to Greece and, to savor it fresh, invited Greece\u2019s prime minister to lunch.</p>\n<p>So, while the streets erupted, while the bank burned, while in the midst of his sleepless, humiliating begging sessions with the IMF and the German Chancellor, George Papandreou was called away to a luncheon with a stout man with a combed-down mustache. It belongs to Thomas Friedman, the world\u2019s most influential writer on economics.</p>\n<p>He is not actually an economist, but he plays one in the pages of the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>\n<p>Friedman had already visited the burnt bank, a \u201cshrine,\u201d as he called it. He arrived at the restaurant beaming with delight and, by his own account, dug into his fish with gusto. The bubbly pundit was so excited that Greece would have to reduce public workers\u2019 pay, freeze benefits, eliminate jobs and welfare entitlements, and cut programs such as school building and road maintenance that you feared he would soil his underpants before the courier delivered his fresh ones.</p>\n<p>Friedman ticked off with relish: 20 percent wage cuts, social security slashed by 10 percent, retirement age increased by four years and massive cuts in government spending. He was thrilled. The flames and mass unemployment, the permanent reduction of wages, he said, would bring about a \u201crevolution\u201d in Greece. And, of course, the post-fire fire sale of national assets.</p>\n<p>Papandreou understood the role of the two Friedmans (Thomas, and before him, Milton). Globalization\u2019s implosion needed apologists, much like the professors and pundits who, a century ago, blithely sang praises of the Bolsheviks while ignoring the rotting bodies. Lenin had a name for them: \u201cuseful idiots.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Friedmans are very useful to the bankers: to take the spotlight off the perpetrators and blame financial ruin on the victims. The U.S. press especially is always ready to blame the victims of financial crime, whether it be home foreclosures or auto plant closings. Teachers and street cleaners who lose their jobs, factory workers who lose their pensions\u2013especially if they belong to unions\u2013are lazy, greedy and guilty. And these sniveling workers are always grasping for their \u201centitlements,\u201d as if collecting Social Security is an avaricious crime, whereas selling bogus bonds to pension funds is simply smart business.\u2003n</p>\n<p><em>This essay was adapted from</em> Vultures\u2019 Picnic: In Pursuit of Petroleum Pigs, Power Pirates, and High-Finance Carnivores <em>(November 2011, Dutton).</em></p>\n<p><strong>Greg Palast</strong> is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>The Best Democracy Money Can Buy</em> (2003) and <em>Armed Madhouse</em> (2007), and the newly released <em>Vultures Picnic: In Pursuit of Petroleum Pigs, Power Pirates and High-Finance Carnivores</em> (2011).

I\u2019m sure you read the news; I\u2019m sure your advisers pass you very important reports that you read. So you know. You know that the Greek economy is entering its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/feb/28/recession-debt-snowstorms-give-greece-chance\">fifth year</a> of recession; you know that the economy contracted by <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-14/greek-economy-shrank-greater-than-forecast-6-8-last-year-on-spending-cuts.html\">6-7 percent</a> last year and is set to contract by another <a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_23/02/2012_429612\">4-6 percent</a> this year.</p>\n<p>You know that the austerity measures that are being imposed by you and your colleagues are actually aggravating the situation. You know this because the IMF actually <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/feb/01/imf-austerity-harming-greeve\">formally stated</a> this; it admitted it in a recent <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-news/greek-debt-could-easily-derail-again-euimf-report/article2344687/\">report</a>. You know it because in a <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/2012/02/more-on-leaked-greek-debt-report/#axzz1oZQaUcrb\">secret document</a> circulated in a meeting between you and your fellow European finance ministers, it was admitted that despite the second bailout, despite the haircut that is being asked of private lenders, Greece will probably still need another bailout by next year.</p>\n<p>At the same time you know that the \u2018bottomless pit\u2019 here is not Greece. You know that the bottomless pits are the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/video/78842834/\">overleveraged financial institutions</a> that overextended themselves on Greek bonds in the lead-up to the crisis. You also know that public spending in Greece \u2014 that much-hated Greek welfare state \u2014 is actually anemic. It\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/05/greek_myth_profligacy.html\">below the EU average</a>. It\u2019s below Germany\u2019s.</p>\n<p>You know all these things.</p>\n<p>You know all these things, yet you continue to impose the same counter-productive austerity measures on the Greek country [<em>sic.</em>], in <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/16f04ffa-5963-11e1-9153-00144feabdc0.html\">complete disregard</a> for the national sovereignty of the Greek people and the democratic legitimacy of the Greek state.</p>\n<p>So I\u2019m asking you, basically, a very simple question: Who are you really trying to help here? Who are you really trying to save? Whose side are you on? The peoples of Europe, or the financial institutions you\u2019re trying to serve?</p>\n<p><em>Note: if you are reading this article in your RSS feed or email inbox, you will have to <a href=\"http://roarmag.org/2012/03/video-schaeuble-protest-florence-crisis-austerity-banks/\">visit our website</a> to be able to watch the embedded video.</em></p>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://roarmag.org/2012/03/video-schaeuble-protest-florence-crisis-austerity-banks/\">roarmag.org</a></p>\n",

The Bank of Scotland then allegedly distributed the money among 20 banks throughout Europe allowing them to engage in a high-profit scheme which accumulated trillions more dollars over the course of eight years; and all off the books. Blackheath states that Alan Greenspan was an eyewitness to the initial transfers, and that Timothy Geitner signed off on claims that that the funds were backed by 750,000 tons of gold, despite the fact that this is more than four times the estimated total of gold ever mined from the Earth (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold\" target=\"_blank\">approximately 150,000 \u2013 160,000 \u00a0tons</a>, according to the most liberal estimates). Lord James has a reputable history with regards to the investigation of money laundering by terrorist organizations, and is known for having exposed the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61219-0006.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Iraqi \u201csupergun\u201d program</a>. He lists three possible scenarios as to how the events transpired:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Lord James of Blackheath:</strong> There are three possible conclusions which may come from it. First, there may have been a massive piece of money-laundering committed by a major Government who should know better. Effectively, it undermined the integrity of a British bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland, in doing so. The second possibility is that a major American department has an agency which has gone rogue on it because it has been wound up and has created a structure out of which it is seeking to get at least \u20ac50 billion as a pay-off. The third possibility is that this is an extraordinarily elaborate fraud, which has not been carried out, but which has been prepared to provide a threat to one Government or more if they do not make a pay-off. These three possibilities need an urgent review.</p>\n<div>\n<h1 id=\"art_headline\">UK House of Lords Asked to Initiate Investigation Into Massive International Financial Fraud</h1>\n<div>Brian Walker</div>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.nationofchange.org/uk-house-lords-asked-initiate-investigation-massive-international-financial-fraud-1330100279\">NationofChange</a> / News Report</div>\n<div>Published: Friday 24 February 2012</div>\n<div>Lord James of Blackheath lays out the case for an investigation into $15 trillion in financial fraud.</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://secure.nationofchange.org/bags?ref=article_main\"><img src=\"http://c681724.r24.cf2.rackcdn.com/ditchthebag-sidebar.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.nationofchange.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/article_main_image/ukhouseoflords22412.jpg\" alt=\"Article image\" width=\"480\" height=\"288\" /></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.nationofchange.org/uk-house-lords-asked-initiate-investigation-massive-international-financial-fraud-1330100279#comments\">Post a Com\u00adment</a></div>\n<div>Re\u00adsize Text + | &#8211; | R</div>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.nationofchange.org/reader/7681\" target=\"_blank\">Plain Text</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.nationofchange.org/print/7681\" target=\"_blank\">Print</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationofchange.org%2Fuk-house-lords-asked-initiate-investigation-massive-international-financial-fraud-1330100279\" target=\"_blank\">SHARE</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.nationofchange.org/uk-house-lords-asked-initiate-investigation-massive-international-financial-fraud-1330100279#\">Email</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_James,_Baron_James_of_Blackheath\" target=\"_blank\">Lord James of Black\u00adheath</a> spoke dur\u00ading a meet\u00ading of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201212/ldhansrd/text/120216-0002.htm#12021643000172\" target=\"_blank\">the UK House of Lords on Feb\u00adru\u00adary 16</a> and pro\u00adduced ev\u00adi\u00addence of $15 tril\u00adlion in what he claims are fraud\u00adu\u00adlent trans\u00adac\u00adtions from the Fed\u00aderal Re\u00adserve Bank of New York, to Hong Kong Shang\u00adhai Bank\u00ading Cor\u00adpo\u00adra\u00adtion (HSBC), which then trans\u00adferred the funds to the Bank of Scot\u00adland.

These three pos\u00adsi\u00adbil\u00adi\u00adties need an ur\u00adgent re\u00adview.</p>\n<p>In April and May 2009, the sit\u00adu\u00ada\u00adtion started with the al\u00adleged trans\u00adfer of $5 tril\u00adlion to HSBC in the United King\u00addom. Seven days later, an\u00adother $5 tril\u00adlion came to HSBC and three weeks later an\u00adother $5 tril\u00adlion. A total of $15 tril\u00adlion is al\u00adleged to have been passed into the hands of HSBC for on\u00adward tran\u00adsit to the Royal Bank of Scot\u00adland. We need to look to where this came from and the his\u00adtory of this money. I have been try\u00ading to sort out the se\u00adquence by which this money has been cre\u00adated and where it has come from for a long time.</p>\n<p>It starts off ap\u00adpar\u00adently as the prop\u00aderty of Yohannes Riyadi, who has some claims to be con\u00adsid\u00adered the rich\u00adest man in the world. He would be if all the money that was owed to him was paid but I have seen some ac\u00adcounts of his show\u00ading that he owns $36 tril\u00adlion in a bank. It is a ridicu\u00adlous sum of money. How\u00adever, $36 tril\u00adlion would be con\u00adsis\u00adtent with the dy\u00adnasty from which he comes and the fact that it had been ef\u00adfec\u00adtively the em\u00adper\u00adors of Indo-China in times gone by. A lot of that money has been taken away from him, with his con\u00adsent, by the Amer\u00adi\u00adcan Trea\u00adsury over the years for the spe\u00adcific pur\u00adpose of help\u00ading to sup\u00adport the dol\u00adlar.</p>\n<p>Mr Riyadi has sent me a re\u00admark\u00adable doc\u00adu\u00adment dated Feb\u00adru\u00adary 2006 in which the Amer\u00adi\u00adcan Gov\u00adern\u00adment have called him to a meet\u00ading with the Fed\u00aderal Re\u00adserve Bank of New York, which is nei\u00adther the Fed\u00aderal Re\u00adserve nor a bank. It is a bit like &#8220;Celebrity Big Brother&#8221;. It has three names to de\u00adscribe it and none of them is true. This as\u00adton\u00adish\u00ading doc\u00adu\u00adment pur\u00adports to have been a meet\u00ading, which was wit\u00adnessed by Mr Alan Greenspan, who signed for the Fed\u00aderal Re\u00adserve Bank of New York of which he was chair\u00adman, as well as chair\u00adman of the real Fed\u00aderal Re\u00adserve in Wash\u00ading\u00adton. It is signed by Mr Tim\u00ado\u00adthy Gei\u00adth\u00adner as a wit\u00adness on be\u00adhalf of the In\u00adter\u00adna\u00adtional Mon\u00ade\u00adtary Fund. The IMF sent two wit\u00adnesses, the other being Mr Yusuke Horiguchi. These gen\u00adtle\u00admen have signed as wit\u00adnesses to the ef\u00adfect</p>\n<p><strong>16 Feb 2012 : Col\u00adumn 1017</strong></p>\n<p>that this deal is a proper deal. There are a lot of other sig\u00adna\u00adtures on the doc\u00adu\u00adment. I do not have a pho\u00adto\u00adcopy; I have an orig\u00adi\u00adnal ver\u00adsion of the con\u00adtract.</p>\n<p>Under the con\u00adtract, the Amer\u00adi\u00adcan Trea\u00adsury has ap\u00adpar\u00adently got the Fed\u00aderal Re\u00adserve Bank of New York to offer to buy out the bonds is\u00adsued to Mr Riyadi to re\u00adplace the cash which has been taken from him over the pre\u00advi\u00adous 10 years. It is giv\u00ading him $500 mil\u00adlion as a cash pay\u00adment to buy out worth\u00adless bonds. That is all in the agree\u00adment and it is very re\u00admark\u00adable. Es\u00adtab\u00adlish\u00ading whether I have a cor\u00adrect piece of paper is just two phone calls away-one to Mr Gei\u00adth\u00adner and one to Mr Greenspan, both of whom still pros\u00adper and live. They could eas\u00adily con\u00adfirm whether they signed it. Mr Riyadi, by pass\u00ading these bonds over, has also put at the dis\u00adposal of the US Trea\u00adsury the en\u00adtire asset back\u00ading which he was al\u00adleged to have for the $15 tril\u00adlion. I have a let\u00adter from the Bank of In\u00addone\u00adsia which says that the whole thing was a pack of lies. He did not have the 750,000 tonnes of gold which was sup\u00adposed to be back\u00ading it; he had only 700 tonnes. This is a piece of com\u00adplete fab\u00adri\u00adca\u00adtion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://secure.nationofchange.org/?em=2\">Most news sources are funded by cor\u00adpo\u00adra\u00adtions and in\u00advestors.

I am quite pre\u00adpared to recog\u00adnise that one of the pos\u00adsi\u00adbil\u00adi\u00adties is that Mr Riyadi is him\u00adself putting this to\u00adgether as a forgery in order to try to win some re\u00adcov\u00adery. But it gets more com\u00adpli\u00adcated than that be\u00adcause each of the $5 tril\u00adlion pay\u00adments that came in has been ac\u00adknowl\u00adedged and re\u00adceipted by se\u00adnior ex\u00adec\u00adu\u00adtives at HSBC and again re\u00adceipted by se\u00adnior ex\u00adec\u00adu\u00adtives at the Royal Bank of Scot\u00adland. I have a set of re\u00adceipts for all of this money. Why would any bank want to file $5 tril\u00adlion-worth-$15 tril\u00adlion in to\u00adtal-of re\u00adceipts if the money did not exist? The money was first said to have come from the Riyadi ac\u00adcount to the Fed\u00aderal Re\u00adserve Bank of New York and from there it was passed to JP Mor\u00adgan\u00adChase in New York for on\u00adward tran\u00adsit to Lon\u00addon. The means of send\u00ading it was a SWIFT note which, if it was gen\u00aduine, ought to have been reg\u00adis\u00adtered with the Bank of Eng\u00adland.When this came about, I took it to my noble friend Lord Strath\u00adclyde and asked what we should do with it. He said, &#8220;Give it to Lord Sas\u00adsoon. He is the Trea\u00adsury&#8221;. So I did, and my noble friend Lord Sas\u00adsoon looked at it and said im\u00adme\u00addi\u00adately, &#8220;This is rub\u00adbish. It is far too much money. It would stick out like a sore thumb and you can\u00adnot see it in the Royal Bank of Scot\u00adland ac\u00adcounts&#8221;. He went on to say, &#8220;The gold back\u00ading it is ridicu\u00adlous. Only 1,507 tonnes of gold has been mined in the his\u00adtory of the world, so you can\u00adnot have 750,000 tonnes&#8221;. That is true. The third thing he said was, &#8220;It is a scam&#8221;, and I agree with him. The prob\u00adlem is that at that point we stopped look\u00ading, but we should have asked what the scam was in\u00adstead of just nod\u00adding it off.</p>\n<p>We have never re\u00adsolved it. Today, I have this quite fright\u00aden\u00ading piece of paper, which is my jus\u00adti\u00adfi\u00adca\u00adtion for bring\u00ading it into this meet\u00ading. It is avail\u00adable on the in\u00adter\u00adnet and I am as\u00adton\u00adished that it has not al\u00adready been un\u00adearthed by the Trea\u00adsury be\u00adcause every alarm bell in the land should be ring\u00ading if it has. It is from the gen\u00aderal audit of\u00adfice of the Fed\u00aderal Re\u00adserve in Wash\u00ading\u00adton-the real Fed\u00aderal Re\u00adserve-and its audit</p>\n<p><strong>16 Feb 2012 : Col\u00adumn 1018</strong></p>\n<p>re\u00adview to the end of July 2010 on the Fed\u00aderal Re\u00adserve Bank of New York. It has on it some 20 banks listed to which $16.115 tril\u00adlion is out\u00adstand\u00ading in loans. That is the sore thumb that was being looked for by my noble friend Lord Sas\u00adsoon. But more par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly there are two other in\u00adter\u00adest\u00ading things. The first is that Bar\u00adclays Bank has $868 bil\u00adlion of loan, and the Royal Bank of Scot\u00adland has $541 bil\u00adlion, in which case one has to ask a ques\u00adtion, be\u00adcause they could have earned back in three weeks their en\u00adtire in\u00addebt\u00aded\u00adness and could pay off the tax\u00adpay\u00aders of Britain. Why have they not done so and could we please ask them to put a cheque in the post tonight for the whole $46 bil\u00adlion?</p>\n<p>The next thing that is wrong with it is that every bank on this list, with\u00adout ex\u00adcep\u00adtion, is an MTN-reg\u00adis\u00adtered bank, which means that they are reg\u00adis\u00adtered to use medium-term notes to move funds be\u00adtween them\u00adselves with an agreed profit-share for\u00admula, in which case these banks are in\u00advest\u00ading this money and, most ex\u00adtra\u00ador\u00addi\u00adnar\u00adily, not a penny of in\u00adter\u00adest does the Fed\u00aderal Bank of New York want paid on that vast amount, $16 tril\u00adlion. Any\u00adone who knows what the IMF rules are will im\u00adme\u00addi\u00adately smell a rat. The IMF has very strict rules for val\u00adi\u00addat\u00ading dodgy money. There are two ways of doing it. You ei\u00adther pass it through a major cen\u00adtral bank like the Bank of Eng\u00adland, which ap\u00adpar\u00adently re\u00adfused to touch this, or you put it through an MTN-trad\u00ading bank, which is then able to use the funds on the overnight Eu\u00adro\u00adpean MTN trad\u00ading mar\u00adket where they can earn be\u00adtween 1 per cent and 2.5 per cent profit per night. The com\u00adpound in\u00adter\u00adest on that sum is huge. If it is gen\u00aduine, a vast profit is being made on this money some\u00adwhere.</p>\n<p>I be\u00adlieve that this is now such an im\u00adpor\u00adtant issue that I have put every\u00adthing that I have got on the sub\u00adject on to a 104-megabyte mem\u00adory thumb. I want the Gov\u00adern\u00adment to take it all, put it to some suit\u00adable in\u00adves\u00adtiga\u00adtive bu\u00adreau and find out the truth of what is going on here, be\u00adcause some\u00adthing is very se\u00adri\u00adously wrong. Ei\u00adther we have a huge amount of tax un\u00adcol\u00adlected on prof\u00adits made or we have a vast amount of money fes\u00adter\u00ading away in the Eu\u00adro\u00adpean bank\u00ading sys\u00adtem which is not real money, in which case we need to take it back. I ask for an in\u00adves\u00adti\u00adga\u00adtion and for noble Lords to sup\u00adport my plea.</p>\n<p><strong>5.30 pm</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lord Lea of Cron\u00addall:</strong> My Lords, I am quite happy to be\u00adlieve every\u00adthing that the noble Lord, Lord James of Black\u00adheath, has said. I will be very dis\u00adap\u00adpointed if the noble Lord, Lord Pear\u00adson of Ran\u00adnoch, is un\u00adable to ex\u00adplain how this is all a con\u00adspir\u00adacy by Brus\u00adsels. Will the Min\u00adis\u00adter con\u00adfirm that if you want to buy up the whole world you need a quadrillion? That is the lat\u00adest fig\u00adure.</p>\n<p>This de\u00adbate began with a pre\u00adsump\u00adtion that what hap\u00adpened on 9 De\u00adcem\u00adber was some\u00adthing of a mys\u00adtery. It re\u00admains a mys\u00adtery. In an\u00adswer to the ques\u00adtion posed by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, as to why we walked away on that fate\u00adful night, I can only as\u00adsume, be\u00adcause no other ex\u00adpla\u00adna\u00adtion has been of\u00adfered, that in the mid\u00addle of the night David Cameron&#8217;s phone was being hacked into by Ru\u00adpert Mur\u00addoch. The events of that night pro\u00advided quite use\u00adful bull\u00addog head\u00adlines for the</p>\n<p><strong>16 Feb 2012 : Col\u00adumn 1019</strong></p>\n<p>fol\u00adlow\u00ading day&#8217;s news\u00adpa\u00adpers, in\u00adclud\u00ading the Daily Tele\u00adgraph and the Daily Mail. The bull\u00addog in ques\u00adtion, cited by the chair\u00adman of the 1922 Com\u00admit\u00adtee, was, of course, Win\u00adston Churchill. It is worth quot\u00ading against that back\u00adground of bull\u00addogs from vol\u00adume 3 of Churchill&#8217;s A His\u00adtory of the Eng\u00adlish-Speak\u00ading Peo\u00adples, which he wrote in the late 1930s al\u00adthough it was pub\u00adlished only in 1956.

However, despite five years of economic turmoil, the workings of the financial system are still bewilderingly opaque to many people (including most politicians, it seems!).</p>\n<p>We are therefore pleased to announce the publication of our clear and concise, 24-page &#8216;Nuts &amp; Bolts&#8217; Guide to the ins and outs of the financial sector. From hedge funds to the money markets and derivatives, all of the major players and products are broken down from a critical perspective. With jargon deconstructed, case studies explained and many of the myths about the city and its operations debunked, this booklet is designed to give readers with little or no knowledge of the world of finance and banking an accessible overview of its workings.</p>\n<p>This booklet is the first publication in our &#8216;Banking on Crisis&#8217; series, which also consists in a news research blog (www.bankingoncrisis.org) and a series of ongoing workshops. The next booklet, due out it the next few months, will cover the ongoing economic crisis, its origins and history, the politics of crisis and a breakdown of some of the most common narratives used to explain the current financial meltdown.

The movement has already helped beat back Bank of America&#8217;s plan to start charging a $5 debit card fee.</p>\n<p>Navy Federal Credit Union, the largest credit union in the country, says new account openings in September and October were up 38 percent from a year ago. National Capital Bank, a two-branch community bank in Washington, D.C., says the vast majority of its new account openings in recent weeks have been by fed up Bank of America customers.</p>\n<p>Because credit unions and community banks vary so greatly in size, however, it&#8217;s hard to gauge the total scope of the defections they&#8217;re reporting. For example, the Lower East Side People&#8217;s Federal Credit Union in New York City says it&#8217;s enjoying more than 55 new account openings a week. That&#8217;s a big jump from its average of about 10 new accounts per week, but insignificant when weighed against the portfolios of the nation&#8217;s largest banks.<br />\n<a href=\"http://m.apnews.com/ap/db_16026/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=yTApK5bS\">http://m.apnews.com/ap/db_16026/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=yTApK5bS</a></p>\n",

I did that in order not to incriminate myself. I have spent the last 4 years seeking justice. On Feb. 23rd., 2010, I was fortunate to have Senator David Norris raise the matter in Seanad Eireann (the Irish Senate), and request a response from the Minister of Finance, Mr. Brian Lenihan. Senator Norris concluded by stating that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;there is ministerial responsibility in this matter. This is a grossly serious matter which has been reported to the Financial Regulator. A man has lost his job as a result. He honourably resigned. The degree of breach was 40 times the accepted margin. This is a disaster. If we are not prepared to face the issue and investigate it when it has been laid before the House, there is absolutely no hope for the financial system or its reputation worldwide.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I have made very clear requests that this matter should be examined. How can the Financial Regulator investigate himself? He was in breach of his responsibility. That is the first point. The second is that the bank must be pursued and that the honour of the man whose reputation has been traduced must be restored. It is not too much to ask in this Parliament that this should happen. I want the process to start tonight.&#8221; <a href=\"http://whistleblowerirl.blogspot.com/\">Website</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://debates.oireachtas.ie/seanad/2010/02/23/00012.asp\">http://debates.oireachtas.ie/seanad/2010/02/23/00012.asp</a></p></blockquote>\n",

  },
  "content": {
    "rendered": "<div>\n<p>The description and goal of\u00a0<a href=\"http://facebook.com/nov.fifth\">Bank Transfer Day</a>\u00a0is straightforward: If you currently have checking and savings accounts (deposit accounts) with a big bank, the organizers encourage you to remove all of your funds, close your accounts, and place your money in a new deposit account with a not-for-profit credit union. The organizers ask that you do this by November 5. And since November 5 is a Saturday, you should definitely do it\u00a0<em>before November 5</em>\u00a0since many big banks aren&#8217;t open on weekends.</p>\n<p>So if you currently have a deposit account with a big bank and you want to participate in Bank Transfer Day, read the following steps. It&#8217;s a field guide that will help you accomplish this meaningful task of shifting your money from corporations that serve the 1% and put it with an organization that cares about the remaining 99%. Bank Transfer Day can significantly impact the way banks are able to make a profit. In simplest terms, banks rely on our deposit account balances to make loans that net substantial profits. Without our deposits, banks can&#8217;t make loans. And if banks can&#8217;t make loans, they&#8217;re going to take notice. And they&#8217;re surely going to freak out.</p>\n<p>What You Need To Do Before Walking Into Your Big Bank Branch</p>\n<p>Go through previous big bank statements to see exactly which accounts you have. Be sure to check the names on each account. If you are closing a joint account with two holders, it makes a difference whether the word joining your names is &#8220;and&#8221; or &#8220;or.&#8221; If the account in your name is in your name\u00a0<em>and</em>someone else&#8217;s, you will both need to go in and close the account. If the account is in your name\u00a0<em>or</em>someone else&#8217;s, either of you can close the account. Some big banks may vary on this policy, so it&#8217;s best to call your big bank to find out exactly what you need to do prior to walking into your local branch.</p>\n<p>1. If you have any loans with a big bank, look closely at your statements and paperwork you signed at the time of closing. There very well might be penalties that will trigger a higher interest rate if you close your checking account. Big banks excel at offering customers lower interest rates on mortgage and auto loans if you open a checking account and maintain a minimum balance. A primary checking account is a bank&#8217;s ultimate goal to securing your, ahem, loyalty. A primary checking account also leads to, on average, the opening of three additional accounts with that financial institution. Decide whether or not you can or have the willingness to pay off the outstanding loan balance. If you do not pay off the loan balance, call your bank to ask about escalating fees or rate increases by closing your checking account\u00a0<em>before\u00a0</em>walking into your local branch to close the checking account.</p>\n<p>2. Stop using your deposit accounts ASAP. You need to allow everything to clear the accounts completely before you close them. This clearing process takes about two weeks to complete. Keep close tabs online to see which transactions are still outstanding.</p>\n<div>\n<p>3. Research non-profit credit unions. You will need a place to deposit your money, so perform this research\u00a0<em>before\u00a0</em>closing your big bank accounts. A good resource for finding credit unions is\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.findacreditunion.com/\">Find A Credit Union</a>. Make your decision on which non-profit credit union you will join\u00a0<em>before\u00a0</em>walking in to the big bank branch to close your deposit accounts.</p>\n<p>What To Do When You Walk Into Your Big Bank Branch</p>\n<p>1. Approach a branch teller and tell him/her that you would like to close your accounts. The teller might hand you off to a customer service representative due to the bank&#8217;s account opening and closing protocol. Or the teller might hand you off because they don&#8217;t want to tie up customers&#8217; wait time in the teller line.</p>\n<p>2. If the bank employee asks why you are closing your account, decide in advance the reason you&#8217;re going to provide. You can tell them you&#8217;re unhappy with big banks. You can tell them you&#8217;re a part of the 99%. Or you can decline to give them a reason. The most important thing is to remain focused and not do anything imprudent that will keep you from accomplishing your goal of closing your deposit accounts and walking out of the big bank branch with your money.</p>\n<p>3. Once the account closing process begins, ask the bank employee if you have any cash reserve accounts tied to your deposit accounts. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to keep a line of credit open that was tied to your soon-to-be closed account.</p>\n<p>4.The bank employee will ask if you would like to receive your money in the form of a check or cash. If you want to make it rain outside of the big bank branch, request to receive cash. If you don&#8217;t want to make it rain, we advise you to request a check.</p>\n<p>5. The bank employee will either give you a confirmation letter of your accounts being closed or they will mail it to you. Once you receive the letter, keep it on file for up to five years.</p>\n<p>6. Walk out of the big bank branch.</p>\n<p>What To Do After You Have Closed Your Big Bank Deposit Accounts</p>\n<p>1. Shred all remaining checks and debit cards. This is an essential step. If you mistakenly use the checks or debit cards, you will be going back to the big bank branch\u2014except this time it will be to clean up your mess.</p>\n<p>2. Go to the non-for-profit credit union you selected prior to closing your deposit accounts at the big bank. Open the accounts, get a new checkbook and debit card, and shake the employee&#8217;s hand, or even give him/her a hug.</p>\n<p>3. Sync up your new deposit account information (ABA routing number and account number for checks, card number, expiration date, 3-digit security code for debit card) to any relevant accounts that require automatic payments. For example, if you automatically pay your car insurance on a monthly basis with your checking account, be sure to sync up your checking account with your car insurance company. You may also want provide your new account information for online products such as iTunes, eBay, and PayPal.</p>\n<p>4. Stand in front of a full-length mirror. Admire yourself. You&#8217;ve earned it.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s all there is to it. Sounds like a lot, and perhaps it is. After all, big banks played a role in making this process difficult because it acts as a deterrent for people to withdraw their money and close their accounts. But if you stick to this guide and remain focused on your goal, you can impact meaningful and measurable change by participating in Bank Transfer Day.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

Hill de\u00a0<strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>; Athanassios Diplas del\u00a0<strong>Deutsche Bank</strong>; Paul Hamill de\u00a0<strong>UBS</strong>; Paul Mitrokostas del\u00a0<strong>Barclays</strong>; Andy Hubbard de\u00a0<strong>Credit Suisse</strong>; Oliver Frankel de\u00a0<strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>; Ali Balali del\u00a0<strong>Bank of America</strong>, y Biswarup Chatterjee de\u00a0<strong>Citigroup</strong>.</p>\n<p>Estos banqueros forman una poderosa comisi\u00f3n que les permite supervisar los\u00a0CDS, instrumentos que, sobre todo en los sectores de los seguros y el petr\u00f3leo, ayudan a inmunizarse ante los riesgos. En teor\u00eda, \u201cese grupo existe para preservar la integridad de un mercado de 700 billones de d\u00f3lares\u201d, equivalente a 12 veces el producto global.</p>\n<p>Los\u00a0CDS\u00a0son el producto estrella de la econom\u00eda mundial y hasta hace algunos meses muy pocos conoc\u00edan su funcionamiento.</p>\n<p>Los\u00a0CDS\u00a0se negocian al margen de los mercados regulados y su tama\u00f1o\u00a0<strong>multiplica por diez la deuda total de Estados Unidos</strong>, que hoy llega a los 75 billones de d\u00f3lares. Es decir, estamos hablando de un negocio que mueve m\u00e1s de 700 billones de d\u00f3lares, y que, por tanto, exige un gran esfuerzo para dar cuenta de estos n\u00fameros: un 7 seguido de 14 ceros. Pero es un esfuerzo necesario para comprender el descalabro financiero en el que est\u00e1 envuelto el planeta.</p>\n<p>v\u00eda <a href=\"http://www.elblogsalmon.com/productos-financieros/la-elite-bancaria-controla-un-mercado-de-700-billones-de-dolares-en-reuniones-secretas\">La elite bancaria controla un mercado de 700 billones de d\u00f3lares en reuniones secretas</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://transitionday.takethesquare.net/files/2011/10/cds_nyt2008.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62\" src=\"http://transitionday.takethesquare.net/files/2011/10/cds_nyt2008.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"270\" /></a></p>\n",

Its purpose is to build a direct link between savers and borrowers who carry out sustainable projects meeting social and ecological criterias. As a cooperative, <strong>la Nef collects savings</strong> from its co-operators through current accounts and deposit accounts ; <strong>it grants loans to professionals and non-governmental organisations</strong> in the social, environmental and cultural sectors.</p>\n<p>La Nef welcomes all citizens requiring an ethical use of money and willing to promote the development of an economy that is respectful of human beings and the environment.</p>\n<p>La Nef has been carrying out and developing its activities for\u00a020 years. It is controlled and approved by the <strong>French Central Bank</strong>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>\nOur values: ethics, transparency, solidarity</h1>\n<h2>\nEthic</h2>\n<p>La Nef provides loans to professionals whose activities contribute to creating social, ecological and cultural benefits more than profit. It puts forward initiatives which enable the development of local economy.</p>\n<h2>\nTransparency</h2>\n<p>In order to create a direct link between savers and borrowers, la Nef\u00a0publishes every year in its annual report the <strong>details of all projects which have been granted</strong> with a loan. As a result, savers can \u201csee\u201d how their money is used ; it also\u00a0facilitates direct contacts between co-operators.</p>\n<h2>\nSolidarity</h2>\n<p>To provide respect and care for human beings and nature is the\u00a0primary engagement of la Nef. It\u00a0provides a bridge of\u00a0solidarity <strong>between those who have money available at one time and those who need money at the same time to carry out their activity</strong>. It also means solidarity <strong>towards the future generations</strong> through the development of ecological and sustainable activities.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>Our partners</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Members of the cooperative can be <strong>individuals\u00a0or institutions</strong>. Larger banks such as the Cr\u00e9dit Coop\u00e9ratif are essential partners in the daily activity. La Nef also works together with the main <strong>French and international networks in the social and ecological fields</strong>.<br />\nLa Nef is <strong>a member of FEBEA and INAISE</strong> amongst a number of other European and international actors in social and ethical finance.</p>\n<h1>A European ambition</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>La Nef belongs to the European network of ethical banks, unified in the European Federation of Ethical and Alternative Banks (FEBEA). Its members work towards developing an economy that promotes solidarity, social cohesion and sustainable development, and rejects exclusive financial gain.</p>\n<p>La Nef is currently involved in the creation of the <strong>first European ethical cooperative bank</strong>, working with other partners that promote ethical finance in Europe. This project aims to <strong>set up a real alternative in the banking sector, based on ethical principles, transparency and solidarity</strong>. The constitution of a working group and the sharing of common values have made it possible to write a \u201cManifesto for a European ethical bank\u201d, the cultural cornerstone of the project.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>Figures</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Key figures on December, 31st 2010:</h2>\n<p><strong>The cooperative Nef:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of co-operators:\u00a027 135</li>\n<li>Capital:\u00a0\u20ac24 875 160</li>\n<li>Balance sheet : \u20ac321\u00a0million</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Saving:</strong>\u00a0fund collections were very strong in 2010. The amount of funds directly managed by la Nef grew 25%, reaching \u20ac97 million by late of the year; resources transiting through Cr\u00e9dit Coop\u00e9ratif rose 20%, hitting \u20ac215 million.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\u00a0236 released loans representing\u00a0\u20ac16.5 million</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>2010 Annual Report:</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lanef.com/lanefenaction/documents/_rapport_en_bref_vGB_ok.pdf\"><strong>Download the 2010 Annual Report in Brief</strong></a></p>\n",

Or, la crise financi\u00e8re a montr\u00e9 que les grandes banques ne m\u00e9ritent plus notre confiance.</p>\n<p>Ce n\u2019est pas l\u2019utilit\u00e9 du service bancaire qui est en question mais le fait que la quasi-totalit\u00e9 des banques fassent du profit non redistribu\u00e9, de l\u2019\u00e9vasion fiscale g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, pour finalement d\u00e9poss\u00e9der les citoyens de leurs force \u00e9conomique.</p>\n<p>Autrement dit, toutes les banques ne se valent pas et le fait que notre argent soit plac\u00e9 dans des institutions financi\u00e8res n\u2019est pas un mal en soi. Au contraire, les banques sont utiles au financement de l\u2019\u00e9conomie. Mais la majorit\u00e9 d\u2019entre elles ont aujourd\u2019hui d\u00e9tourn\u00e9 leur fonction et se servent de l\u2019\u00e9conomie au lieu de la servir.</p>\n<p>Sur le site <a href=\"http://www.jechangedebanque.org/\">JeChangedeBanque.org</a>, nous organisons pour la premi\u00e8re fois collectivement le transfert de notre argent des banques les plus nuisibles vers celles les plus recommandables. Nous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rons que nos \u00e9conomies soient g\u00e9r\u00e9es par des banques qui investissent l\u2019\u00e9pargne localement, ne participent pas au casino financier, refusent d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9sentes dans les paradis fiscaux et de verser des bonus ind\u00e9cents.</p>\n<p>Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un calendrier interactif, chacun pourra annoncer sur <a href=\"http://jechangedebanque.org/\" target=\"_blank\">jechangedebanque.org</a> \u00e0 quel moment il s\u2019engage \u00e0 contacter son banquier pour fermer ses comptes et migrer vers une banque \u00ab\u00a0\u00e9thique\u00a0\u00bb. Ce processus de consommation responsable permettra d\u2019envoyer tr\u00e8s rapidement un message clair tout en permettant aux acteurs financiers vertueux d\u2019accueillir progressivement les nouveaux comptes.</p>\n<p>Comme l\u2019id\u00e9e du <em>bankrun</em>, cette transition collective pose clairement la question de la reprise en main de la finance. Mais contrairement au <em>bankrun</em> elle ne vise pas \u00e0 l\u2019effondrement du syst\u00e8me dont on ne voit pas \u00e0 tr\u00e8s bien \u00e0 qui il profiterait.</p>\n<p>Une banque \u00ab\u00a0\u00e9thique\u00a0\u00bb favorise le d\u00e9veloppement local et raisonn\u00e9, on retrouve donc les meilleures banques comme \u00e9tant les moins polluantes. <em>\u00ab\u00a0Les diff\u00e9rences entre les banques tiennent largement \u00e0 leur mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique plus ou moins tourn\u00e9 vers le financement des grands groupes, mais aussi au choix des secteurs financ\u00e9es, et en particulier le poids des financements apport\u00e9s au secteur p\u00e9trolier\u00a0\u00bb</em></p>\n",

Ils ont \u00e9galement d\u00e9marr\u00e9 le m\u00eame travail en direction des assurances fran\u00e7aises concernant les impacts climatiques de leurs activit\u00e9s.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.financeresponsable.org/\"> http://www.financeresponsable.org/</a><br />\nCe site a pour objectif de sensibiliser les citoyens au choix de leur banque, expliquer l&#8217;utilisation qui est faite de leur argent et faire pression sur les acteurs financiers pour qu&#8217;ils am\u00e9liorent leurs pratiques.</p>\n<p>Les Amis de la Terre et ATTAC m\u00e8nent une campagne commune &#8220;A nous les banques\u00a0!&#8221;, depuis avril 2011.<br />\nCette campagne s\u2019ouvrait par un mois d\u2019\u00e9valuation citoyenne des banques afin de mieux cerner l\u2019impact \u00e9conomique, social et environnemental de leurs activit\u00e9s. A ce jour, huit des dix banques interrog\u00e9es ont r\u00e9pondu au <a href=\"http://www.amisdelaterre.org/IMG/pdf/questionnaire_banques_adt-attac.pdf\">questionnaire</a> qui leur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9, seuls les groupes BPCE et Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel-CIC n\u2019ont rien envoy\u00e9.</p>\n<p>Cette campagne d\u2019ATTAC et des Amis de la Terre, <a href=\"http://www.amisdelaterre.org/Face-a-la-demission-du-G20-Attac.html\">lanc\u00e9e le 14 avril 2011</a> \u00e0 l\u2019occasion du G20 finance, a d\u00e9j\u00e0 mobilis\u00e9 un grand nombre de militants et de citoyens qui ont organis\u00e9 des <a href=\"http://www.amisdelaterre.org/Actions-des-Amis-de-la-Terre-sur.html\">actions de rue</a> dans plusieurs de villes de France, devant les agences bancaires. Ces interpellations au niveau local ont sans aucun doute renforc\u00e9 la pression sur les directions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales des banques.</p>\n<p>ATTAC et Les Amis de la Terre ont publi\u00e9 fin juin 2011 un premier rapport d\u2019\u00e9tape &#8220;<strong><a href=\"http://www.amisdelaterre.org/IMG/pdf/rapport_banques_transparentes.pdf\">Les banques sont-elles transparentes</a></strong>&#8220;, analysant la transparence des diff\u00e9rentes banques au vu de leurs r\u00e9ponses. Un deuxi\u00e8me rapport sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en octobre 2011 cette fois-ci pour porter un jugement sur les pratiques retrac\u00e9es par ces r\u00e9ponses. Ce sera l\u2019occasion de voir si les banques les plus transparentes sont aussi les plus vertueuses.</p>\n<p>Ce premier rapport d\u2019\u00e9tape a d\u00e9j\u00e0 permis de pousser les banques vers plus de transparence, la plupart d\u2019entre elles ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 envoy\u00e9 des compl\u00e9ments \u00e0 leurs r\u00e9ponses initiales.

People all over the world have woken up, people all over the world want to take back control of their money and their lives. They are tired of being fed lies and they have called for everyone around the world to join them in occupying the world. Along with the Occupy movement, we, Anonymous have started #OpCashBack, an op fully dedicated to moving your money from big time banks to local credit unions. This is an operation that can be done by everyone, not just fellow anons. Help us restore the power to the people and rid the big banks of their power over us and politicians. As the saying goes &#8220;money is the root of all evil&#8221; so let us take the money away from the evil. You can start right now, tomorrow or next week, find a local credit union, speak to them about rates and policies, go to your bank, withdraw your money from them and move it to your new Credit Union. Thus, taking away the power that big banks have.</p>\n<p>We are Anonymous<br />\nwe are Legion<br />\nwe do not Forgive<br />\nwe do not Forget<br />\nExpect Us!</p>\n</div>\n<div><strong>Proposal to your assembly:\u00a0</strong></div>\n<div>The proposal is to start an international campaign for everybody to take their money out of the commercials banks and pass it to ethic banks (bank account), credit unions (savings), or invest it in ethic or alternative economy, you can also <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXXyS43h4A0\">build your own financial institution</a>.</div>\n<div>So this action will have two fronts: take\u00a0 the money out from the\u00a0 banksters elites, and also put more money available for sustainable projects who will contribute to everybody and help to heal the world.</div>\n<div>People can do it without changing anything on the way they use their money (debt cards, etc) and they will have a bank account that will not contribute to war and exploitation.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div><strong>What is the plan:</strong></div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>A big campaign of communication to promote this action during the next twenty days in which we need the collaboration of the largest number of assemblies to approve the call and media to spread the informations. So the first step will be to present this proposal to your assembly and\u00a0 create a working group charged to promote the action.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Until the 5th. of November we will spread a lot of texts and videos showing what the traditional banks are doing with our money but also promoting the financial alternatives and the projects they finance. We invite all the assemblies to open the debate locally, share this materials and create new ones adapted to their local situations. So we welcome the video-makers, designers and all the people who can bring informations on this topic.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>The 5th. of November will be the great day where we invite everybody to transfer his money from his bank to an ethic one or credit union,\u00a0 following this simple steps:</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\u2022 Research your local credit unions or ethic banks options (you have until the 5th. of November and we will share a maximum informations and contacts to help you)</div>\n<div>\u2022\u00a0 Open an account with the one that best suits your needs (before the 5th. of November because it will be a Saturday and some of them will be closed)</div>\n<div>\u2022 Cancel all automatic withdrawals &amp; deposits (Before the 5th. of November for more security)</div>\n<div>\u2022 Transfer your funds to the new account (during the 5th. of November if it&#8217;s possible the morning when they are all open)</div>\n<div>\u2022 Follow your bank&#8217;s procedures to close your account before the 5th. of November.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div><strong>Find a credit union (will be updated) :</strong></div>\n<div>USA: <a href=\"http://www.findacreditunion.com/\">http://www.findacreditunion.com/</a></div>\n<div>CANADA: <a href=\"http://locator.cucentral.com/\">http://locator.cucentral.com/</a></div>\n<div>UK: <a href=\"http://www.findyourcreditunion.co.uk/\">http://www.findyourcreditunion.co.uk/</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.reciprocalbank.org/\">http://www.reciprocalbank.org/</a></div>\n<div>SPAIN: <a href=\"http://www.unacc.com/defcajas.html\">http://www.unacc.com/defcajas.html</a></div>\n<div>FRANCE: <a href=\"http://www.credit-cooperatif.coop/\">http://www.credit-cooperatif.coop/</a>\u00a0\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.lanef.com/\">http://www.lanef.com/</a><br />\nFINLAND: <a href=\"http://www.jak.se/international/international\">http://www.jak.se/international/international</a></div>\n<div>BELGIUM: <a href=\"http://www.rentevrij.be/\">http://www.rentevrij.be/</a></div>\n<div>ITALY: <a href=\"http://www.jakitalia.it/\">http://www.jakitalia.it/</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.bancaetica.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bancaetica.com</a><br />\nSPAIN: <a href=\"http://www.coop57.coop/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1\">http://www.coop57.coop/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1</a></div>\n<div>GERMANY: <a href=\"http://www.jak.se/sites/default/files/international/dokument/OZB_Blick_-_December_2008.pdf\">OZB_Blick_-_December_2008.pdf</a>\u00a0\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.gls.de/\">http://www.gls.de/</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.umweltbank.de/\"><br />\nhttp://www.umweltbank.de/</a>\u00a0\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.umweltbank.de/\">http://www.ethikbank.de/</a><a href=\"http://www.umweltbank.de/\"><br />\n</a></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div><strong>Follow-up:\u00a0</strong></div>\n<div>It&#8217;s the moment to be coherent with our ideas, and conscious about the power we have in our hands.</div>\n<div>If the 99% removes our funds from the major banking institutions to non-profit credit unions, ethic\u00a0 banks or other kinds of alternative and social economy on or by this date, we will send a clear message to the 1%, that conscious consumers won&#8217;t support companies with unethical business\u00a0 practices. But\u00a0 we can go further, the 5 is one of the best days to have the most impact on the market and the banking accounting, so if we succeed the 5th. of November we can repeat every 5 of every month this same action, trying to break the record\u00a0 every time.
